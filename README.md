## Introduction

Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are URIs for self-sovereign digital identification.  DIDs reference DID Documents, which are signed data structures containing public keys, authentication methods, service endpoints, and more.

The most current specification is located at https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/

**Did** is the nascent beginning of a PHP library for encoding and decoding DID URIs and documents.  It's designed for PHP 7.
